# techTrek2017

A list of projects for the screen array built for Tech Trek 2017 at The Forge in Ann Arbor.  
This event will happen June 16th, 2017.  See http://annarborusa.org/techtrek/.

We will cover one of the walls at The Forge with a light-up array about eight feet tall and 25 feet wide.
Each light is an 11" round balloon backed by a 32-bit RGBW LED.  The array will be 24 pixels wide by 8 pixels high.

Please fork this repository and send me pull requests for displays that you want to contribute to this event.

## Project List:

### Fun Stuff

**randomMatrix**: This program simulates Hollywood computers from the 1960's.

### Boring Stuff

**singleDotCycleEntireMatrix**:  This program is boring, but useful after initial setup of the screen array.  
It will ensure that the individual LED strands are wired correctly.

**pixelIntegrityTest**: Cycle through all LEDS color-by-color to verify they are all functional

**stressTest**: Verify that the power is adequate for lighting all pixels full blast at the same time
