# IRRemoteControl
Lightweight Arduino Library for send/receive IR signal.

This library can read codes from flash memory if necessary. So when you are creating variables to store the codes to be sent with this library, you can use the [PROGMEM](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/PROGMEM) variable modifier.
