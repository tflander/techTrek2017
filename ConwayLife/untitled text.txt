...but back to the hypothesis that the disciples collectively had false memories of seeing the resurrected Jesus.  First of all, let's look at the explanatory power of this hypothesis.

1 - Jesus died from crucifixion -- The hypothesis fits this fact just fine.
2 - The disciples were willing to suffer for their belief that they were personal witnesses -- The hypothesis fits this fact just fine.
3 - The conversion of the church persecutor Saul -- This is a problem.  Saul was not convinced by the testimony of the disciples.  It was the testimony of the disciples that triggered persecution.  The hypothesis fails.
4 - The conversion of the skeptic James -- This is a problem, perhaps less than the problem of Saul.  James rejected the divinity of Jesus during Jesus' ministry.  He was not in the same state of mind as the disciples.
5 - The empty tomb -- It's conceivable that the empty tomb may have fed the alleged delusion of the disciples.

The hypothesis fits 3 of the 5 facts, but now you need an ad-hoc alternative to explain Saul and James.

But it gets worse.  The disciples did not claim to see a vision or ghost of Jesus.  They claimed to see Jesus himself alive.  People who claim to see their loved ones after death still believe their loved ones are dead.  It's implausible that all disciples would not only believe they saw Jesus was alive (not a vision or ghost), but that they would agree on details without even one saying "wait -- that's not how I remember it".

The explanatory power of the disciples having false memories given the facts is not just far-fetched, it fails to explain the evidence we have from Saul and James.
